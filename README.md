# Deep Learning project 1 - Convolutional neural networks
This project will mainly focuses on CNN algorithms. We will evaluate them in terms of image classification. We will ivestigate how different hyperparameters and data augmentation influence on result. 

## Data 
In our project we will use data from Kaggle platform:
- ("https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mengcius/cinic10")

## Key dates:
- 4th/5th March - Project plan
- 25th/26th March - Initial presentation
